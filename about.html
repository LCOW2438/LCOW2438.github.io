          <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
          <p>
            The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as
            part of their daily exercise routine.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Burpee</dt>
            <dd>
              Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength and
              endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your
              hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and
              then jump up from a squatted position.
            </dd>
        
            <dt>Plank</dt>
            <dd>
              Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up
              position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as
              you can.
            </dd>
            <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
            <dd>
              Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the
              floor in a push-up position, bring one knee up to your chest, and then
              switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).
            </dd>
